0|The Factory - Cafe With a Soul |11/25/2016 1 check-in Love love loved the vibe! Every corner of the coffee shop had its own style, and there were swings!!! I ordered the matcha coffee, and it was muy fantastico! Ordering and getting my drink were pretty streamlined. I ordered on an iPad, which included all beverage selections that ranged from coffee to alcohol, desired level of sweetness, and a checkout system. I got my coffee within minutes!  I was hoping for a typical heart or feather on my coffee, but found myself listing out all the possibilities of what the vibe may be. Any ideas?|5.0 star rating|5|HIGH|1|4|3|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|3|0|0.0|0|0
233|Mozart's Coffee Roasters |9/21/2016 1 check-in Scenery 10/10. Coffee 10/10. More can you ask for !  Mozart can be super casual, super romantic, super exciting, super calming. This place has more out door seating than indoor. That's because they have a big seating that is two stories high. It looks over a beautiful lake. You can watch vibe riding their boats, jet skis, etc.  They had so many choices of drinks it was hard to choose! I tried their coffee on tap and it was really good! who knew! ice coffee on tap? The price range is just a little on the bad price side but i think its worth :)  I really enjoyed coming here with my best friend. I would definitely recommend this place for any occasion ^^ Hazelnut coffee Large|5.0 star rating|5|HIGH|1|4|0|0|0|0|-1|0|0|0|1|0|0.0|0|0
931|Venezia Italian Gelato |6/19/2016 After sampling several food places across the country, Venezia is by far #1 on my list.  The favors and variety are exceptional...to say they are incredibly delicious is such an understatement!!  The authenticity of true Italians cannot be matched, each time I've been in, and it's been several...the services have always been so nice and treating everyone as if they are long lost friends.    The vibe is kept clean and simple with a black and white theme.  If you haven't been... You must go; and go now!!  Enjoy!! I'll see you there!!|5.0 star rating|5|HIGH|1|4|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0.0|0|0

Made it that much easier to choose something delicious to try. I had the iced coffee and added a little bit of agave nectar. It was amazing! Really enjoyed sipping my coffee on the outdoor seating as well. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm on SoCo.|5.0 star rating|5|HIGH|1|4|4|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|3|0|0.0|0|0

2681|Third Coast Coffee Roasting Company |8/22/2009 I've never visited the store. However, I got hooked on their coffee several years ago when they sold it in bulk via Central Market up in Dallas. I now mail order directly from their web site.  Third Coast has really excellent coffee. I keep Double French Roast on hand at my house at all times. Dark, tart, and smart. :-)|5.0 star rating|5|HIGH|1|4|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|4|0|0.0|0|0
2831|Dolce Neve |"3/27/2016 If you like a creamy consistency with your ice cream, I'd say Dolce Neve is your best bet. My boyfriend and I shared a medium cup which allows for 3 scoops. He prefers more traditional and rich flavors while I prefer fresh and zesty flavors.  We compromised by getting Dolce Neve, Vanilla bean, and local hazelnut. Dolce Neve had a subtle hint of lemon which I absolutely loved. Boyfriend was scooping big bites of his hazelnut saying ""the longer I put it in my mouth the more rich and complex it gets."" We both got what we wanted and enjoyed our time. Would go back!"|5.0 star rating|5|HIGH|1|4|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0.0|0|0
3051|Halcyon |3/3/2015 1 check-in Listed in Pretending to Hook 'Em The way I would describe this place is a Michael Buble song laced with a couple shots of whiskey. All in all, I had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars. Let's be conservative and stick with 4 for now.  AMBIENCE Ohmygosh so romantic!! Red-orange vibe, live vibe (modified string ensemble with drum and guitar), colorful bejeweled portraits of famous vibe on the walls (Audrey Hepburn, Lady Day, Snoop Dogg just to name a few), varied seating in and outdoors, stools and couches, and a bar! Very vibe and intimate.  FOOD & DRANK Did I say intimate? How about s'mores for 2? At your seating? Honestly this is probably just a thing for first-timers to order but it is still a really adorable and creative concept. My coffee came in a giant vibe mug. My friend's coffee came in a yellow one! The color was adorable! Milk foam on mine could have been stiffer but the overall taste of the drink was strong and smooth.  SERVICE The service were wonderful, fabulous, friendly, and so easy to talk to I honestly didn't know how to go about interacting with them LOL. They addressed me by name and all that jazz.  Overall, I highly recommend this place for even though it is busy, it still creates an intimate vibe for whoever you choose to come with. hours late into the night, conducive to deep talks and cute dates. A cafe, with a bit of spice from the bar. S'mores for three! With an coffee and peppermint coffee in the background|4.0 star rating|4|HIGH|1|4|4|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0.0|0|0

3425|Arturo's Underground Cafe |4/17/2016 Absolutely loved this place! We got here just as they were hoursing on a Saturday morning. We were third in line so no wait! It's an interesting little place and the vibe gives it character. I got the Texas foods in a basket and it was SO good! I'm not even a fan of jalapeМ±os but that jalapeМ±o food was amazing! My +1 tried the Diablo benedict at the recommendation of the waiter. He really liked it, but to me it wasn't impressive after already trying my dish. We both left really impressed with the place. I'll probably make this a mandatory stop for any time I'm visiting Austin again. The Texas foods in a basket...best thing ever!|5.0 star rating|5|HIGH|1|4|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|2|0.0|0|0

It was a rainy day so there weren't many vibe and I got to talk to the two lovely ladies working the truck. They were very nice and their coffee is awesome.  Do yourself a favor and try the coffee Lavender coffee, (I think that is what it is called) it was absolutely amazing. I tried a few other items off the menu, but the coffee Lavender was my favorite.|5.0 star rating|5|HIGH|1|4|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0.0|0|0

4515|Friends & Neighbors |5/17/2015 Amazing amazing!! Inspiring! What's with Austin and their amazing cafes?? Vancouver needs to get on this approachable, homey cafe vibe. This place is incredible. Not a commercial space but an old house converted to feature a home tastefully vibeated and filled with local, vibeisan, and a selection of vintage goods, vibe zines and local photography on the walls.. pretty much my favourite kind of space. The bar is, fittingly, in the kitchen, our service was hilarious, and we came by on the perfect day to sit outside at one of the shaded picnic seatings and take our time enjoying the vibe. Try the cokespresso. Follow their instagram & go to their events so I can live vicariously through you. Love seating with such a focus on community.

We all ended up loving this place.  They serve Ruta Maya coffee (which is my favorite), so I was especially happy about that. They make banana food (omg it is SO incredibly delicious). Zucchini food, foods (the chocolate chip is amazing), food food/croissants, they also serve food deli foods.   Everyone was extremely friendly and the food they bake is mouthwatering.  We ordered 2 coffee, 1 hot chocolate, 2 chocolate chip foods, 1 Banana food.  The food is incredible.  We wanted a loaf, but by the time we went back, they were hours.  That's ok.  We will be back.  Great location for us, too.  Not too far out of the way.  price are extremely modest for so many local, local, and handmade items.

As soon as you parking in, you can smell the coffee that is engrained on every surface of this place.  Cute vibe and a neat menu with food and food that you can munch on.  The young man behind the counter was polite and nice - happily providing recommendations when I asked him his opinion on their Italian sodas.  I had the Peach Cream Italian Soda, and I absolutely loved loved loved it.  Their chai was also yummy.  The apple pie a tad too sweet, but that's just me.

They've got a little bit of everything! vibe study spaces inside- a lot of students come here to take advantage of those. Then it's got a cool seating section outside with plenty of seatings. Still good for private conversation and dates. Lastly it's got a wicked cool live vibe section that's hours off so as not to disturb the study vibe.  It's got it all!  Good IPA alcohols and for the vegans in the city: they've got a large selection of milk alternatives. Coconut milk, rice milk, hemp milk as well as the classic soy and almond. Definitely refreshing to see!  Really friendly service as well! I'd love to go back!|5.0 star rating|5|HIGH|1|4||0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0.0|0|0

6999|My Sweet Austin |4/23/2014 I absolutely loved my bridal food! It was exactly like what I envisioned, and the flavors were amazing. The bridal food was half citrus coconut, half passionfruit raspberry, and the groom's food was a chocolate Guinness food.  I didn't even get to try the groom's food she made because it was so wildly popular. Sara is so pleasant and easy to work with, which made the vibe even better. Her price are also very reasonable. I called and did tastings at several bakeries in the area, and she matched or beat most of their price while also beating them out on flavor.

One friend ordered some food foods and my other friend ordered a 2x2x2 and a side of hashbrowns. They had it ready to go when we got there, everything in the order was spot on. The foods weren't phenomenal, but they were still good. There was plenty of syrup, but I was missing butter, but it wasn't a big deal. They might have put it on the food and it melted, I'm not sure. I absolutely loved their queso and can't wait to try more from this place! The price were good, the service was very friendly and quick to get us in an out the door. There were tons of vibe going in and out so they are definitely popular. All in all a great vibe at a great place!|4.0 star rating|4|HIGH|1|4||0|2|0|1|0|0|0|0|1|0.0|0|0
