# Bike Counts

For this skill drill, you will formulate a hypothesis about the number of bikes crossing the Brookyln Bridge using the New York Bike Counts dataset. This dataset shows the number of bikes that crossed each of the bridges during each day. Use this dataset to formulate a hypothesis and then use linear regression to test if your hypothesis was correct. 

## Instructions

1. Formulate a hypothesis about the number of bikes crossing the Brooklyn Bridge using the New York Bike Counts dataset.

2. Use your knowledge of linear regression models to create a hypothesis test to evaluate your null and alternative hypotheses.

3. Look at the reported p-value of your linear regression and determine if there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
